This is used to simulate clearing just cycles of length two (direct consumer
to consumer) versus the housing solution, clearing the longest cycle first
every time. In order to simulate, comment out the correct half of the code
(either comment out the second half and leave the first half if you want to 
run the longest cycle approach, otherwise comment out the first half and leave
the second half).

Can change number of edges on line 50 (i < ###). TiernanSimpleCycles takes to 
long to run on sets of edges much larger than a few hundred, but YRMV.
